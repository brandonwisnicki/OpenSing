# OpenSing
PennApps 2020 Hackathon Project

This is a personal challenge to build something with a fierce team of 1 for a hackathon! I also wanted to improve my C++ skills along with learning the basics of OpenGL.

Anyone can play their karaoke files given the audio and the custom .sing file, which is a specialized JSON object containing the lyrics and timing. You can view an example in the songs directory.

The King's Can't Help Falling in Love with You is an example preloaded with OpenSing.

Built with C++ and OpenGL
