# OpenSing - An open-source karaoke format and player


Anyone can play their karaoke files given the audio and the custom .sing file, which is a specialized JSON object containing the lyrics and timing. You can view an example in the songs directory.

Elvis Presley's recording of "Can't Help Falling in Love" is an example song preloaded with OpenSing.
